JBoss Server Migration Tool
=================

The JBoss Server Migration Tool is a tool that migrates JBoss Application Servers. It reads the server configurations files for a previous release of WildFly or JBoss EAP, referred to as the source server, and migrates them to this (target) server. Besides the configurations, the tool is also capable of migrating modules, deployments and other resources found in the source server.

System Requirements
------------

* [Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) or later

Run the Server Migration Tool
------------

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `../bin/` directory.
2. Run the following command.

        For Linux|Mac:   ./jboss-server-migration.sh --source SOURCE_SERVER_PATH
        For Windows: jboss-server-migration.bat --source SOURCE_SERVER_PATH

    Replace `SOURCE_SERVER_PATH` with the path to previous version of the server installation that you want to migrate from, for example:  `${user.home}/jboss-eap-6.4/`

3. When you execute the command, the tool displays a list of the files to be migrated and then prompts you whether you want to continue.

        -------------------------
        Migration Result: SUCCESS
        -------------------------        
10. Review the information in the `reports/` directory.
  * `migration-report.html`: The HTML report is a nicely formatted report showing the detailed results of the migration. For more information, see [Review the Migration Report](#review-the-migration-report).
  * `migration-report.xml`: The XML file is used to format the HTML report. For more information, see [Review the Migration XML File](#review-the-migration-xml-file).
11. Review the information in the `logs/` directory.
  * `migration.log`: The log contains detailed information about the modified configuration files and subsystems. For more information, see [Review the Migration Log](#review-the-migration-log).
12. Review the updated files in target server installation directory. Note the original configuration and properties files are backed up and now have the suffix `.beforeMigration`.

Review the Migration Report
------------
The `reports/migration-report.html` HTML report file is a nicely formatted output detailing the results of the migration. It contains the following sections.

* _Summary_: This section displays the time of the migration, the source and target server releases and paths, and the result of the migration.
* _Environment_: This section describes the reporting environment, including the path of the migration tool.
* _Tasks_: This section summarizes the tasks that were run during the migration. It then provides the details of those tasks in a hierarchical, collapsible, easy to read format. Tasks are grouped by server, and within server, by server type and configuration.

<a name="review-the-migration--xml-file"/>

Review the Migration XML File
-----------------------------

The XML file is used to format the HTML report. This file can be imported into your favorite spreadsheet or other tool where you can manipulate and process the data.

Review the Migration Log
-----------------------

The migration log contains detailed information about the modified configuration files and subsystems.

* Informational messages about the tasks performed and migration results begin with `INFO`. Look for message codes beginning with `WFLY` for more detailed information about the migration results. Some informational messages might require action or review. The following are examples of informational messages.

* Error messages, which appear in red in the server console, describe the problem encountered in the migration and often how to resolve it. Most errors require action. The following are examples of an error messages.

        ERROR [org.jboss.as.ejb3] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYEJB0474: Attribute 'default-clustered-sfsb-cache' is not supported on current version servers; it is only allowed if its value matches 'default-sfsb-cache'. This attribute should be removed.

    _NOTE:_ If you have any deployments to your old server configuration, you may see error messages similar to the following.

        ERROR [org.jboss.as.server] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0057: No deployment content with hash 029f689e292c7cbe680ad330edd50440da51d7a3 is available in the deployment content repository for deployment jboss-mail.war. Because this Host Controller is booting in ADMIN-ONLY mode, boot will be allowed to proceed to provide administrators an opportunity to correct this problem. If this Host Controller were not in ADMIN-ONLY mode this would be a fatal boot failure.
